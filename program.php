                <p>
                    <strong>Aggelos K. Katsaggelos</strong> received the Diploma degree in electrical and mechanical 
                    engineering from the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, 
                    Greece, in 1979 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees both in electrical engineering 
                    from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, in 1981 and 1985, 
                    respectively. In 1985 he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and 
                    Computer Science at Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, where he is currently 
                    professor, holder of the AT&amp;T Chair (previously holder of the Ameritech Chair). 
                    He is also the Director of the Motorola Center for Seamless Communications, an

                    NY. His current research interests include multimedia signal processing (e.g. 
                    image and video recovery and compression, audio-visual speech and speaker recognition, 
                    indexing and retrieval), multimedia communications, computer vision, pattern recognition, 
                    and DNA signal processing. He has published extensively in these areas. He is the 
                    editor of Digital Image Restoration (Springer-Verlag 1991), co-author of Rate-Distortion 
                    Based Video Compression (Kluwer 1997), co-editor of Recovery Techniques for Image 
                    and Video Compression and Transmission, (Kluwer 1998), and co-author of Super-Resolution 
                    of Images and Video (Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers 2007) and Joint Source-Channel Video 
                    Transmission (Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers 2007). Prof. Katsaggelos has served in the
